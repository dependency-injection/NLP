Hello my name is Aaron Prince and I study at symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies And Reserch. I love playing the guitar and I admire guitarists like Joe Satriani. I also love playing football. Watching people play badminton annoys me. I am also annoyed by people who behave very socially awkward when in a gathering.
